**SQL Data Warehouse Project**

This is my first attempt at creating a Data Warehouse using the YouTube video from Data with Baraa. In this project, I will create a data warehouse using SQL Server. I will also be using tools like Notion to track my progress and draw.io for any planning that requires drawing a plan.

Below is the Architecture of the Data Warehouse
